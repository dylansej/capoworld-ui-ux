# capoworld-ui-ux
Mobile app UI/UX concept designed in Figma – Work in progress.

## 🧭 What is CapoWorld?

CapoWorld is a mobile app concept inspired by Bolivian culture and folklore.  
The idea behind the project is to create a platform similar to Google Maps, but focused on helping users discover **fraternities and dance groups** around the world.

Users will be able to:

- View nearby fraternities based on their current location  
- Explore fraternities of different Bolivian dance styles (Caporales, Tinkus, Morenada, Salay, and more)  
- Filter results by the dance they want to learn or join  
- See photos, descriptions, and details of each group  

---

## 🌍 Community & Support Features

Fraternities that want to appear in the app will be able to:

- Submit their group through a "Support" or "Contact" section  
- Upload their name, photos, description, location, and contact info  
- Have their submission reviewed and approved by an administrator (me) before going public  

This helps maintain accuracy, quality, and trust within the community.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

CapoWorld aims to connect dancers, communities, and new members with authentic Bolivian dance groups across the globe.  
It’s a mix of:

- cultural preservation  
- discovery  
- community building  
- technology  

All in one place.
